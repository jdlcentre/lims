# John de Laeter Centre Laboratory Information Management System
This LIMS system is designed to assist scientific researchers and laboratories in capturing, managing and disseminating research data and metadata.

It aims to be as domain and instrument agnostic as possible to allow for flexibility of workflows and to reduce the burden of set up. [Work is still underway to properly achieve this].

The LIMS currently has support for:
* publishing analysis metadata to ReDBox instances
* publishing geological sample metadata to the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR)
* processing TESCAN TIMA MinDIF files to generate geochemical classification panoramas
* storage of data in:
  * network attached drives
  * geospatially enabled databases (e.g. PostGIS)
  * Pawsey Supercomputing Centre storage services
